BigMart-Project

Big Mart Sales Prediction Project is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the sales of products across different outlets of Big Mart. Using historical sales data and features like item type, outlet location, and visibility, this project builds predictive models to estimate product sales and help in inventory planning and business decisions.

Key Features:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Handling missing values and zero entries

Feature engineering for better model performance

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights

Machine learning models to predict sales (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Evaluation of model accuracy using appropriate metrics

Tools & Technologies Used:

Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

Git & GitHub for version control

Objective:
To accurately predict product sales at Big Mart outlets to assist in inventory management, optimize stock levels, and improve overall business efficiency.
